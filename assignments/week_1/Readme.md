**Bicycle Rider Assistance System for Sam (BRASS)**

The goal of this project is to build a Bicycle Rider Assisnatce System for Sam (BRASS) which displays bike speed, incination on a LCD display and a resettable MCU input power level LED indicator to the rider. BRASS is also being considered to be built up for the final project.



**System Architecture:**

STM32 MCU based Dev board with on-board Gyro and LCD

External Wheel Speed sensor

On board Led to display low battery level for Dev board

On board push button (to reset the led)

On board LCD to display speed, inclination and battery state to the rider
